Hi all, this is a model created by Yucan Dong, Merve Tunali and Bernd Nowack. The model is developed with machine learning to predict the effect of biochar to soil organisms. The file "Biochar_ML_Effect.Rmd" is a R notebook with code in it. You can run the model. Those CSV files in the directory are used for running and training of models.
