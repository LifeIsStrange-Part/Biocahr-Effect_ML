Hi all, this is a model created by Yucan Dong, Merve Tunali and Bernd Nowack. The model is developed with machine learning to predict the effect of biochar to soil organisms. The file "Biochar_ML_Effect.Rmd" is an R notebook with code in it. You can run the model with Rstudio. 

Those CSV files in the directory are used for running and training of models. The "Knitted code.html" is created by the knit function in R, it's a presentation of the code with prediction result. 

Best,
Biochar Machine Learning Teams
